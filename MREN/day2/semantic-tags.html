                <h2>Education is Important</h2>
                <p>To put it in simple terms, education is the process of acquiring knowledge and skills, building morals, values,
                     and developing habits. Education does not just consist of these. The process of education can be 
                     said to be complete only if you are able to put the knowledge you acquire to good use. So, 
                     education is not just gaining knowledge and gathering information but developing the ability to 
                     apply what you have learned to daily life scenarios.</p>
